    <h3>An autobiography by chatGPT-3</h3>
    <p class="p1"><h4 id="chatgpt-chatgpt-chatgpt">“chatGPT chatGPT chatGPT“</h4>
<p>The buzz around the tech world is so noisy that, by now, you probably heard of or played with chatGPT. When I started to learn more about chatGPT and was thinking how chatGPT-3 can help me in my day-to-day life. Well, I am a Software Engineer and hate writing engineering documents. A thought splash in my mind, “Hey, why don’t we ask chatGPT to do the work for me?”</p>
<p>As I stated get my hands dirty on chatGPT-3, as all of us do, I was searching for more info about chatGPT. I decided instead of searching (Googling?), I turned into chatGPT itself. Yes, I decided to ask chatGPT about itself. This is an attempt to make chatGPT write about itself and hence the blog “An autobiography by chatGPT-3”.</p>
<h4 id="first-thing-first">First thing first:</h4>
<p>I googled chatGPT (Hmm, cannot avoid Google search) and landed on the OpenAPI web site. I navigated to <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart">https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart</a> and played with the “try now” examples. I signed up a personal account with chatGPT which requires your mobile number for verification. Don’t be surprised if you are asked to wait to try your chatGPT “completion”. So many people are trying and sometime chatGPT server must queue the requests. Once you all set with your account, there is a “playground” and I was playing with it.</p>
<h4 id="time-to-ask-about-itself">Time to ask about itself:</h4>
<p>First, I asked the chatGPT “Write chatGPT blog”. You might wonder why I used minimal words in the “prompt”. But there is something called “tokens” in NLP beside I am an Engineer too.  There is a restriction in using number of tokens. Ie, you pay for number of tokens. The more detailed “prompt” gives accurate answers. The more tokens mean more money.</p>

<p>Now, you can see the content is not enough for a blog! So, I decided not to let chatGPT go and
asked more questions from the answer like we do in the IT interview process.
Next, I asked “How chatGPT works”. Here is the details of chatGPT and my conversation.</p>

<img src="/images/post1/how_chatgpt_works.png" alt="" width="750" height="400">

<p>Clearly not enough for a blog. My ‘ego’ did not let chatGPT go and forced the chatGPT to
respond for “the potential applications of GPT technologies”.</p>

<p>This back-and-forth conversation between chatGPT and me happened for a while and
somewhere I had to stop. The following is the content that chatGPT told me about itself.</p>

<em>&ldquo;Write chatGPT blog&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the chatGPT blog! Here you can find all the latest news and updates about chatGPT, a natural language processing (NLP) technology
powered by generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models. We’ll be covering topics such as how chatGPT works, the various use cases for it,
and the potential applications of GPT technologies in general. Stay tuned for more insights on this exciting new technology!</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;how chatGPT works&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) system that can generate human-like conversations. It works by using a deep learning model
trained on a large dataset of human conversations, which allows it to understand the context and generate responses that are more relevant to
the conversation. The system takes input from the user&rsquo;s conversation and uses its neural network to generate an appropriate response. The
model then selects the most likely response from the list of generated options. Finally, the response is returned to the user for further
interaction.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;the various use cases for ChatGPT&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Human-Computer Interaction: ChatGPT can be used in a conversational agent or chatbot to provide natural language responses to questions
and commands. The bot can also be used to generate personalized conversations with users.</li>
<li>Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks: ChatGPT can be used for text generation such as summarization, question answering, dialogue
generation, story generation, etc.</li>
<li>Social Media &amp; Information Retrieval: ChatGPT can be used to generate relevant social media posts, blog entries, and other content related to
a given topic. It can also be used to retrieve information from webpages and databases using natural language queries.</li>
<li>Productivity Applications: ChatGPT can be used to automate mundane tasks such as writing emails, creating reports, scheduling
appointments, etc.</li>
<li>Education &amp; Training: ChatGPT can be used to create interactive tutorials, presentations, and simulations that respond to user input in realtime.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&ldquo;the potential applications of GPT technologies&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>GPT technologies can be applied in a variety of areas, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural language processing (NLP): GPT models can be used to improve the
accuracy and performance of NLP systems for tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and natural language
understanding.</li>
<li>Autocompletion: GPT models can be used for autocomplete applications that suggest words or phrases as users type.</li>
<li>Text generation: GPT models can be used to generate text from scratch, allowing developers to create new stories, articles, poems, and jokes.</li>
<li>Image captioning: GPT models can be used to automatically generate captions for images. 5. Speech recognition: GPT models can be used to
enhance speech recognition systems by providing better context-aware understanding of spoken commands.

</ul>
<h4 id="summary">Summary:</h4>
<p>chatGPT is AI and the “completion” are based on the “prompt”. We all get different answers as
we ask the questions differently. chatGPT also offers many parameters (hyper params?) that we
can adjust to change the accuracy. Once such param is “temperature”. There are endless
possibilities in engineering world for chatGPT application. It is a milestone achievement in the
NLP area.</p>
